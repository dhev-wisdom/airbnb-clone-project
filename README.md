## 🗃️ Database Design
The database schema is structured around key entities that represent core components of the Airbnb platform. Each entity includes essential fields and is connected through relational mappings to support real-world use cases like reservations, payments, and reviews.

### 👤 Users

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier (primary key)

email: User's email (used for login)

password: Hashed password for authentication

is_host: Boolean flag to distinguish hosts from guests

id: Unique identifier

user_id: Reference to the guest making the booking

property_id: Reference to the booked property

start_date: Check-in date

end_date: Check-out date

Relationships:

A booking is made by one user

A booking belongs to one property

## 🔐 API Security
Security is critical to building trust and maintaining the integrity of user data, transactions, and platform operations. This project implements several key security mechanisms:

### 🔑 Authentication
JWT-based authentication is used to verify the identity of users securely.

Tokens are issued on login and are required for accessing protected endpoints.

### ✅ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users (e.g., hosts vs. guests) can perform specific actions such as managing properties or bookings.

### ⛔ Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a user or IP can make within a given timeframe.

### 🔒 Secure Data Handling
Passwords are stored using strong hashing algorithms.

Sensitive operations (e.g., payments) use HTTPS and token-based validation.

Input validation and sanitization help prevent injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Why It Matters:

Protecting User Data: Email, password, and booking history must be secured.

Securing Payments: Financial transactions should be tamper-proof and encrypted.

Platform Integrity: Preventing unauthorized access and spam ensures reliability and trust.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline
### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automatically testing and integrating code changes.
Continuous Deployment (CD) ensures that once code passes tests, it's automatically deployed to production or staging environments.

### Why It’s Important
Faster Development: Automates testing, building, and deployment of new features.

Fewer Bugs: Immediate feedback on code quality and security.

Deployment Confidence: Every push goes through a standardized, repeatable deployment pipeline.

### Tools Used
GitHub Actions (planned): For running tests, linting, and deployment.

Docker: Ensures consistency across development and production environments.

Kubernetes (optional): Supports scalable deployment and rolling updates.
